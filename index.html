She went on to graduate from Denver's own <a href="http://east.dpsk12.org/" target="_blank">East High School</a>. East's rigorous approach prepared her well to do her undergraduate work at <a href="http://www.carleton.edu/" target="_blank">Carleton College</a>, where she deepened her love of physics, computer science, and learning. She graduated in 2013 with a Bachelor of Arts in Physics degree. She went on to receive her Master of Education degree from <a href="http://www.bu.edu/" target="_blank">Boston University</a> in 2015</p>
